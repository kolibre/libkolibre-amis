      Safety is about keeping safe and knowing what to do in an emergency.

      Have you heard people say:
    </p>
		<p id="dol_1_4_rgn_cnt_0030">
      "Only swim between the flags"
    </p>
		<p id="dol_1_4_rgn_cnt_0031">

      These are statements that people sometimes say to make others aware of keeping safe.

      The safety series encourages the reader to think about their safety in different situations. Each book identifies aspects of home, school or the local environment that present risks to safety or protect people from danger.

      Fires start when something hot meets something that can burn. Fires produce heat, light and smoke.
    </p>
		<p id="dol_1_6_rgn_cnt_0054">
      Many fires are good. We use fire to cook our food and to keep warm. Most cars burn fuel in their engines. So do trains and planes.

       Caption: Campfires can be fun when in the outdoors, but it is important to never leave them unattended as they can quickly turn into bigger, more dangerous fires.

		<p id="dol_1_6_rgn_cnt_0057">
      Good fires can quickly turn into bad fires. Bad fires can turn into disasters such as bushfires and burning buildings. Most bad fires happen when someone is careless and allows a fire to get out of control. However, some people cause fires deliberately.

		<p id="dol_1_7_rgn_cnt_0061">
      There are many fire dangers at home, and many ways to make fires safe at home.
    </p>
		<p id="dol_1_7_rgn_cnt_0062">
      Fires at home are mostly used for heating and cooking. Gas burners may be used for room heating or water heating. Matches and lighters are used in most homes.
    </p>
		<h2 class="sub-section" id="dol_1_8_rgn_cnt_0063" lang="en">Heating</h2>
		<p id="dol_1_8_rgn_cnt_0064">
      An open fire in the living area should always have a fire guard in front of it. This stops sparks from jumping out of the fire, which could then set something else on fire. It also prevents someone accidentally falling into the fire and small children from reaching in to touch the fire.
    </p>

		<p id="dol_1_8_rgn_cnt_0067">
      Heaters, too, can get hot enough to burn. Many heaters now have automatic cut-off switches that turn them off if they over-heat or tip over.
    </p>
		<p id="dol_1_8_rgn_cnt_0068">
      Heaters and open fires should always have a clear area around them. Flammable things left close to a fire or heater can catch alight easily.

		<p id="dol_1_9_rgn_cnt_0071">
      It is easy to get burnt from hot things when cooking. Pot and pan handles should be turned away from you so that they cannot be bumped accidentally. Some people put guard rail around the edge of a stove to prevent pots being knocked off the stove altogether.
    </p>
		<p id="dol_1_9_rgn_cnt_0072">
      Barbecues are popular for outdoor cooking. Matches are needed to light a barbecue or some stoves. Matches can be dangerous and should only be used by adults or under adult supervision. People cooking on a barbecue should not leave it unattended.

      If a fire starts to burn at home, a smoke alarm will give off an early warning. This early warning may give people time to get safely out of a burning house. Smoke alarms should be checked regularly to make sure they are working.
    </p>
		<h2 class="sub-section" id="dol_1_13_rgn_cnt_0087" lang="en">A fire escape plan</h2>
		<p id="dol_1_13_rgn_cnt_0088">
      Some families have a home fire escape plan. A home fire plan usually includes at least two different ways to get out of every room, and out of the house. A special meeting place is arranged so a family can check that everyone is out of the house. The fire escape plan is practised regularly to make sure that everyone in the family knows what to do.

		<p id="dol_1_14_rgn_cnt_0093">
      If you see flames or smoke, try to let someone in your family know. Shout "Fire!" or bang on the walls. If a room is filled with smoke, get down on the floor and crawl towards the door. Smoke rises so it will be easier to breathe if you are down low below the smoke.
    </p>
		<p id="dol_1_14_rgn_cnt_0094">
      Touch the door to see if it is hot. If it is hot do not open it. Cover the crack under the door with something like a blanket or jumper, and look for another way to get out of the room--such as a window. If it is a high window, you can throw something soft down on the ground first. Then lower yourself down before dropping to the ground.
    </p>
		<p id="dol_1_14_rgn_cnt_0095">
      Once you are safely out of the house, find a telephone and dial "000" to contact the fire brigade. Then go to your special meeting place and wait with your family for the fire brigade to arrive. Never go back into the house.

      Like many big buildings where there are a lot of people, schools must be built from materials that do not burn quickly. They must also have fire escapes and exit signs.
    </p>
		<p id="dol_1_15_rgn_cnt_0099">
      Some buildings have fire extinguishers that adults can use to put out small fires. Some also have automatic sprinklers to cool a fire.

      Fires can start in big public buildings such as shopping centres, office buildings, cinemas and stadiums. Like schools, these buildings must be built from materials that do not burn quickly. They must have fire escapes and exit signs. They also have automatic sprinkler systems that come on when there is a fire, and fire alarms that are connected directly to fire stations.

      In the country there are usually a lot of materials such as grass and sticks to keep a fire burning for a long time. When fires start in the bush, forests or grasslands they can quickly get out of control. Hot, dry, windy days help fires spread even further.

      People who live in or close to forests or bush areas are especially aware of fire. When bushfires are near they listen to the local radio and television for fire warnings. If there is a fire warning, people may be advised to leave their homes if there is plenty of time, or stay inside and take certain steps if the fire is very close.

		<p id="dol_1_21_rgn_cnt_0129">
      People whose homes are in or near bushland are at risk of being caught in a bushfire. If this happens, usually the safest thing for them to do is to stay inside their homes. Sometimes people hose their houses with water. This makes it harder for a house to catch alight.
    </p>

      If you are caught outdoors during a bushfire, find or make a clear space and lie down on the ground. Cover yourself with blankets or clothing to shield yourself from the heat. Move away from places up-hill from the direction of the fire because heat rises. Never run uphill to try to get away from a fire because fires travel faster uphill.

      If you are caught in a car during a bushfire, there are many things you can do to protect yourself. If possible, the car should be parked in a burnt-out area. Closing all the windows and vents can stop much of the smoke from getting into the car. Turning the headlights on makes it easier for other cars or the fire brigade to see you. Getting down onto the car floor and covering yourself with a cotton or wool blanket or extra clothing can help you to breathe more easily and keep you cooler.

		<p id="dol_1_22_rgn_cnt_0137">
      In Australia, the bushfire danger season is between October and March when the weather is mostly hot and dry. Special permission is needed to light a fire in the bushfire danger season.

		<p id="dol_1_23_rgn_cnt_0141">
      Sometimes farmers or park rangers set fires deliberately in rural areas. This is called controlled burning. It is done just before summer to reduce the amount of natural fuel such as leaf litter, grass and sticks. Then, if there is a bushfire, it is less likely to burn quickly.

		<p id="dol_1_24_rgn_cnt_0146">
      During the fire danger season warnings are given on days of extreme fire danger on radio and television. On these days no fires may be lit in the open. This means you are not allowed to have any sort of fire outside, including a barbecue.

		<p id="dol_1_25_rgn_cnt_0154">
      Fire fighters are trained to fight fires. They wear special clothing and sometimes even breathing masks to help them to breathe. They know how to keep themselves and the public safe during all sorts of fires.
    </p>
		<p id="dol_1_25_rgn_cnt_0155">
      In urban areas, fire fighters may use water from a fire hydrant to put out a fire. Sometimes they may also use water from a swimming pool, creek or river if there is one nearby.
    </p>

      To fight fires in high-rise buildings fire fighters have special folding ladders. Ladders also help them to reach rooftops and high windows, and to rescue people.
    </p>
		<p id="dol_1_25_rgn_cnt_0160">
      In country areas many fire fighters are volunteers. They use special tankers filled with water that they take to the fire. They may also use planes and helicopters to drop water onto areas that cannot be reached by road.

      When someone telephones "000" to report a fire the information is directed to the Fire Brigade Communication Centre.

    </p>

      The fire fighters then get ready with their protective clothing and climb into their trucks.
    </p>
		<p id="dol_1_26_rgn_cnt_0170">
      When they arrive at the fire, they will use whatever equipment is necessary to put out the fire and rescue any people who may need help.
    </p>
		<p id="dol_1_26_rgn_cnt_0171">
      Sometimes fire fighters need extra help from the police or ambulance service. The State Emergency Service (SES) or other volunteer organisations can sometimes help, too.

		<p id="dol_1_27_rgn_cnt_0175">
      If you get burnt, you can cool your skin by immediately putting it under cold running water. Hold the burn under cold water for at least ten minutes, and even up to thirty minutes.
    </p>
		<p id="dol_1_27_rgn_cnt_0176">
      If your clothing catches fire, do not try to run. Stop, drop down and roll on the ground. Rolling will squash the fire and put it out. If the fire is burning upwards, use your hands to shield your face. You can also use blankets or coats to smother a fire, if you have them.
